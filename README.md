# VMware TAP and VAC workshop
Welcome to this combined TAP plus VAC workshop. 
Here you will learn how to deploy a simple Spring Boot application into TAP connected a backend Postgress Database deployed on TAP by VAC automation. 

We recommend you use Chrome, Edge, or Firefox browsers in this workshop for the smoothest experience.

Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) enables enterprises to deliver a developer experience atop Kubernetes. Operators are able to customize and deploy an application-aware platform, instead of requiring developers to write platform-aware applications.

Tanzu Application Platform abstracts away the mechanics of container orchestration, secure software supply chains, and GitOps deployment/promotion models. It allows developers to focus purely on the authoring of business logic, user interfaces, and APIs. Meanwhile, the operations teams can declare compliant delivery processes that will be implemented, in a consistent, automated, repeatable manner to each new application workload that is onboarded.

This demonstration will show how development teams and operators will interact with the platform to enable iterative development cycles, and secure, automated delivery to production.

# About this Workshop
We are running this workshop inside of Learning Center, a Kubernetes-native hosted environment that is distributed with Tanzu Application Platform.

Learning Center provides on-demand access to an in-browser experience that simulates the IDEs, terminal windows, and web interfaces you'll be using when you actually work with Tanzu Application Platform, plus instructional pages like this one that halp guide the experience.

You are free to enter your own commands to experiment in this environment, or you can click on helper macros like this one to automatically enter commands for you:

Terminal: Execute command in terminal "1"

'kubectl config get-contexts eduk8s'

Now, let's start delivering software with Tanzu Application Platform.
